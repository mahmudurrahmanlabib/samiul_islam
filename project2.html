                were required to create a face mask based on a specified theme as part of this
                course. The mask's theme was &quot;broken windows theory,&quot; which was the
                term’s Curriculum Integration topic. This was a group project that served as
                the course's final project. The masks were created with plaster of Paris and
                water. Sumiya Sultana and Jinnat Areefen, two of my group mates, and I agreed
                to make this mask for my face. They applied a thin layer of Vaseline on
                Jannat’s face first so that the mask could be easily removed once it had dried.
                They then broke the plaster into small pieces, wet them with water, and placed
                them one by one on Jannat’s face until the plaster covered my entire face.
                Sumaiya then smoothed the plaster on Jannat’s face, making the mask’s surface
                consistent. We waited until the mask was completely dried before removing it.
                We were able to remove the mask from face with a little pull. We placed the
                mask in the corner of a room to settle for the night. I painted the masks
                according to our concept the next day, after they had hardened, and applied the
                proper decorations such as green trees, leaves, and a house. The masks were
                again left to dry overnight. I held our masks on the day of the presentation as
                we explained our project to our renowned professors and peers.</span></p>

                introduced in 1982, says that disorder and crime are linked, and that disorder
                can have a negative impact on society, leading to a high prevalence of offences
                and crimes. Broken Windows is described as a literal illustration of a broken
                window in an essay by James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling. When describing
                the idea, they use the example of a broken window to illustrate what they are
                talking about: they basically argue that if there is a broken window somewhere
                and no one does anything to fix it, then other windows will be broken. Broken
                Windows is based on the premise that by cracking down on minor types of crime,
                criminals will stay away from that area, resulting in a safer environment for
                everyone involved.</span></p>

                this semester CI theme was ‘Broken Windows Theory’. In the 1982 article
                &quot;Broken Windows,&quot; two social scientists James Q. Wilson and George L.
                Kelling developed the Broken Windows idea for the first time. The analogy of
                broken windows is used to describe this hypothesis, which states that displays
                of disorder in a neighborhood limit residents’ attempts to demonstrate social
                control. This theme mean that which is forbidden to humans.&nbsp; They do it
                more. The Broken Windows theory is based on the concept that any type of urban
                blight — a broken window, graffitied walls, trash on the streets, and so on –
                causes no harm&nbsp; to a neighborhood provided it is swiftly fixed. If, on the
                other hand, it is left unattended, it indicates a lack of care in the
                community, the kind of environment in which residents are free to abandon any
                ideals of concern. The first stage of damage and decay is physical, but the
                second stage is psychological. When James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling
                published “Broken Windows: The Police and Neighborhood Safety&quot; in the
                Atlantic Monthly in 1982, it became well known as the Broken Windows theory.
                The reasons why tiny neighborhood snubs should not be overlooked were outlined
                in the article: &quot;A property has been abandoned, and a window has been
                damaged. Adult cease criticizing boisterous children, and the children become
                more rowdy as they grow older. Families disband, and single adults&nbsp;take
                their place. Teenagers congregate outside the corner store. They refuse to move
                when the merchant begs them to do so. Fights take place. Litter builds up over
                time. People begin to drink in front of the supermarket; eventually, an
                inebriated individual slumps on the pavement and is permitted to sleep it off.
                Panhandlers approach pedestrians&quot;&nbsp;</span></p>

                core message of this project is to understand how our trash impacts the
                environment.&nbsp; For a long time, the garbage that humans produce has been
                harmful to our environment.&nbsp; Humans produce far too much garbage and are
                unable to dispose of it in a sustainable way.&nbsp; Our oceans and landfills
                are overflowing with waste that isn't biodegradable or can't be recycled
                adequately. In certain places of the world, the burning of huge, open piles of
                garbage emits dangerous quantities of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that is
                warming our planet.&nbsp; Our negligence puts human health at risk. We continue
                to produce vast amounts of rubbish and fail to properly dispose of it, which
                will ultimately be our undoing, as it is for the environment and wildlife in
                the eco-system, we all share. With the way we handle our planet, we cannot
                prevent or encourage lifespan. The more emissions we make as a result of the
                amount of waste we generate, the longer we are affected.&nbsp;</span></p>

                project plan was to show the side effects of nature due to trash/garbage.
                people cannot live their life because of the bad effect of nature. On the other
                hand, people create the bad effect of nature. Poor waste management leads to
                climate change and air pollution, as well as having a direct impact on a
                variety of ecosystems and species. Landfills, which are considered the last
                resort in the waste management hierarchy, produce methane, a potent greenhouse
                gas connected to global warming. I wanted to make the two side of mask so that
                one side will show the bad effect which is surviving and another one is good
                effect of nature which is living properly. I did draw this which is show the
                natural effects. I did add some objects on the board. Which is about the
                nature. I did choose the acrylic colors and these was specific colors- green,
                red, sky blue, brown, yellow. my plan was people who live properly, they can
                lead their healthy life and we are just surviving for our life. It’s the
                healthy way. So, we became sick and unhealthy day by day. Cause poor waste

                nature, and with red eyes to represent result of environmental damage. The mask
                was then placed on the board. the board was black, so we painted on it and made
                joyful and sad versions of the environment. We painted two trees on each side.
                The tree on the left side is not healthy because people are dumping dirty

                exhibition at Bangladesh Shilpakala Academy began on April 27th, 2019. It was a
                fantastic experience because it was the first time something we created was
                displayed in such a large national art exhibition venue. The most successful
                aspect of the CI program is the display. Because, prior to the exhibition,
                students must actively participate in their curriculum in order to develop
                something creative that they can display in front of an audience. The audience
                included persons of various ages and socioeconomic groups. Despite the fact
                that many of them were ULAB students, instructors, and staff. The location was
                ideal for the exhibition because it is in the center of town and is easily
                accessible to everyone. Also, art enthusiasts are accustomed to visiting
                Shilpakala Academy, therefore the location is ideal in our opinion. My parents
                went to my exhibition. It seemed to me more special because it was the first
                exhibition of my work and my parents were at this exhibition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

                link with the artwork and the CI forum's topic. We received mostly favorable
                responses, and people seemed to understand the theme of the artwork. Faria
                Islam, an IUB student who enjoys going to exhibits. We spoke with her and she
                expressed her admiration for the artwork. &quot;Our environmental problems must
                be addressed quickly, and first and foremost, people must&nbsp; modify their behavior,&quot;
                she continued, &quot;otherwise we will confront a large number of&nbsp;
                problems very soon.&quot; Then we spoke with Nian Hossain, a member of the ULAB
                Art &amp; Photography Club, who admires the artwork's simplicity and believes
                it represents the current environmental crisis. Another ULAB student, Amman
                Hossain, comprehended the concept of the artwork, but he read the color
                combination differently. He explained the meanings of cyan, red, blue, and

                doing this project, we learn that communicating a message via art is not

                may not be able to satisfy everyone, but you should strive to provide a place
                for the audience to consider your product in a new light. Doing a project with
                painting, specify the theme with colors, understand the meaning of colors was
                not easy. It was challenging. We'll try to paint the face more smoothly if we

                learn about color theory so that we may utilize more colors to communicate the theme messages.
