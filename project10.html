                Covid-19 pandemic has forced educational institutions all over the world to
                adapt to new sustainable models and leave behind their traditional practices.
                In Bangladesh’s context, adapting to the new normal has been a challenge
                because we are yet to be accustomed to digitalization as other developing
                nations have. In terms of higher education, many private universities have
                shifted operations online in order to ensure ceaseless curricula for existing
                students however, in the case of recruiting new students, private universities
                have been able to ensure smooth online admission process, but the number of
                admission seekers has dropped drastically amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Out
                research finding has exhibited a 50% decline in the number of admission seekers
                at the University of Liberal Arts, Bangladesh (ULAB). Though ULAB has taken
                upon many initiatives to ensure persistent admission process for admission
                seekers, the number of admission seeker is still under deficit. Private
                education institutions in Bangladesh lag behind in terms of adaptation to the
                practices of the fast-moving world of Industry 4.0. There is no doubt that
                private educational institutions are doing their level best to carry on with
                academic activities online, however, it is imperative that these institutions
                comprehend the gravity of the situation and figure solution that can be sustained
                in the long run. In this research, we identified the strategic shift of ULAB’s
                admission process and proposed a systemic review of their assets to improve
                their website, recruiting process, and online presence.</span></p>

                educational institutions to focus more on their online domain features,
                security, and information. The best educational institutes have implemented
                digital marketing of at least 8 (eight) types, namely: SEO (search engine
                optimization), content marketing, influencer marketing, marketing automation,
                e-mail automation, campaign marketing, e-commerce marketing, social media
                marketing: Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram (Pride &amp; Ferrell, 2016, 256). </span></p>

                pandemic is a recent incident, and its changing effects are being felt every
                day. The missing gap in our existing knowledge or literature is relevancy.
                While there are research papers/journals focusing on the impact of Covid-19 on
                different aspects, there lacks solid and relevant data in the Bangladesh’s
                context. Therefore, in light of these abovementioned gaps we have extensively
                analyzed previous research work from different countries that has a similar
                context to Bangladesh. We have identified our issues and given the time
                constraint our research evaluates the shift to new processes; how is ULAB
                shifting and adapting to the new normal; what logistical, technological, and
                human support does the university require and how feasible is the new process.
                Most importantly, the research sheds light on how the ULAB authority is
                planning to conduct their admission process as well as the ongoing education
                curriculum in this ongoing pandemic and lockdown.</span></p>

                of 3 in secondary and higher secondary education, in that case, ULAB is taking
                viva over phone to assess admission seeker’s competence. Prior to the pandemic,
                in order to qualify for admissions at ULAB, admission seekers would need a
                minimum GPA of 2.5 in both, secondary and higher secondary education. </span></p>

                has signed up for a diverse set of medium for promotions starting from

                Covid-19 pandemic brought about a huge impact on economies all over the world
                and Bangladesh was no exception. In order to curb losses, all entities except
                the ones governed by the state, sought various cost-cutting methods. The two
                most common methods being pay cuts and terminating employees, brought about a
                huge downfall in household income leading to financial instability for the
                majority families be it lower, lower-middle-, or middle-class families. The
                financial instability among households led families to their own cost cutting
                measures; leaving out private education as a luxury that the majority affected
                households cannot afford. Mr. Zamal believes the damage to global economies
                caused by Covid-19 has brought about financial uncertainty among households
                leaning students towards public universities more instead of private
                universities. It can be clearly seen in the case of ULAB’s enrolment figures;
                the number of admission seekers dropped drastically by 50% since the influx of
                the Covid-19 pandemic. </span></p>

                order to keep up with the Covid-19 pandemic, like many universities across the
                world, ULAB too began recruiting students online in March 2020. Prior to the
                pandemic, admission seekers at ULAB had the option to apply for admissions
                online and in person at ULAB admissions office and then attend entrance exams
                at university premises. Now, admission seekers can only apply online and get
                confirmation of their application within 30 minutes from the ULAB admissions
                office along with further information they might need for forthcoming events,

                to the pandemic, ULAB would assess admission seekers via admission exams
                conducted by ULAB at its premises. Since it is no longer an option for the time
                being, ULAB has taken up a different method of assessment; students carrying
                GPA 3.0 in their secondary and higher secondary exams are eligible for
                admissions. While this assessment method eases the application process for
                students, it also brings about a huge concern regarding the credibility of the
                process. In one way, such an assessment method is viable as students have
                already proven themselves eligible for admissions with their prior education
                grades, however, students applying for particular concentrations such as
                engineering, need to be assessed through a module that the university can use
                to analyze their competence. In this case, ULAB is yet to implement any
                measures to ensure admission seekers’ credibility. </span></p>

                order to have a steady flow of students amid the pandemic, ULAB has taken many
                measures to smoothen the admission process for students. If we look at the
                financial aspects, we can see that the university has brought down its
                admission fee to 50%. This indeed is a good initiative taken by the university
                however, in such times, giving a discount on a one-time payment might not be a
                viable solution. In order to attract students, ULAB can opt for reducing
                tuition fees for the time being. Since the beginning of the pandemic, all
                physical operations (apart from some crucial activities like security and
                maintenance) at ULAB have been halted. This has led the university to benefit
                from the reduced fixed and temporary costs (electricity bill, student and
                faculty transport costs, co-curricular activities funds) that it would have to
                bear if the physical operations were still on-going. If ULAB takes this aspect
                into account, the university can easily offer discounts on tuition fees for new
                students who, otherwise, will turn towards the next best alternative. </span></p>

                has also increased marketing expenditure to enhance its digital presence. While
                this attempt will be fruitful in reaching a higher number of audiences which
                can attract potential applicants, there still exists a gap between effective
                online marketing and ULAB’s firm digital presence. Bangladesh has recently
                stepped into the digital world but now that we have stepped into a pandemic, an
                educational institution’s digital presence needs to be efficient and accessible
                to the user before the institution spends a huge budget on marketing. In ULAB’s
                case, the university is carrying out marketing initiatives online however, its
                online platform is not well equipped and ready to handle its online marketing
                activities. Taking into account ULAB’s primary online domain – its website, it
                is not as user-friendly as it should be. When admission seekers visit the
                website, the admission requirements being displayed still state that a student
                needs a minimum GPA of 2.5 in secondary and higher secondary education in order
                to be eligible for admission at ULAB whereas, the university is now preaching
                an update set of requirements through social media promotion. This error leaves
                a huge room for misunderstanding and miscommunication between ULAB and
                admission seekers. An admission seeker can easily get confused due to this
                miscommunication and it could, in turn, delay his/her decision-making process.
                Some might even not feel confident with their decision of getting admitted to
                ULAB after seeing misinformation and consider not getting admitted to ULAB. </span></p>

                over the world are in a very vulnerable position since the end of 2019, life
                must go on and thus, entities and people must find ways to adapt to the new
                normal. Like many educational institutions over the world, ULAB is taking upon
                new means to ensure ceaseless education for existing students and to-be
                students.  However, the strategic shifts currently being implemented by ULAB in
                its student admission process amid Covid-19 may only be effective in the
                short-run. In order to sustain in the long run amid an ongoing pandemic, ULAB
