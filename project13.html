                talk to a friend or someone we are comfortable with? Is it the same? No,
                definitely not. we talk without a hitch. Because we know that person and we
                have faith in them to not mock me even if you mess up.</span></p>

                my opinion the basic difference in these two kinds of speaking is how we deliver.
                Whenever we think about public speaking the first thing that comes to our mind
                is, it’s a big deal! We have to maintain proper mannerism and all the other
                rules that come with it. we have to stick to a specific format, the language
                has to be neat and we have to deliver it in front of the audience with
                perfection, and the list just goes on.</span></p>

                WHEN ever we are talking to a person who is close to us, we never bother to
                think even for a heartbeat. We just talk as if we are telling a story. And that
                storytelling gives us a proper way of communication, we can convey our thoughts
                just the way we want to. Anxiety, nervousness such concepts just flies out of
                the window. Tell me one thing, which one is easier to remember? Bullets points
                from a power point presentation or a simple heart touching story? Of course,
                it’s the story, right? Because you will forget about all those bullet points
                unless you have a super strong memory. But when it comes to a story it just
                engraves itself into peoples’ mind. And above all, it’s far easier to tell a
                story rather than giving a formal speech.</span></p>

                guess the obvious question here is, how are we supposed to give a presentation
                through a story? Ok, let me give me an example. Say, you are presenting a
                formal guideline for public awareness about Corona Virus, It might not leave an
                impactful impression. Because presenting a formal guideline means you are
                addressing the mass in general. What do you think will happen if you convey the
                same cautionary messages through a story of a small family, like, in a family,
                what every member Could do to prevent corona virus, what kind of miseries may
                befall if they get affected, what to do if your child/mother/beloved one get
                affected with corona virus, what kind of changes should be made in their daily
                life and so on.  If you can tell a story like that it doesn’t matter if you are
                talking to hundreds of people at a time, each of them will be able to relate it
                to their own family life, and while they are busy thinking about their own
                family they won’t care if you have made any mistake in your presentation. Each
                of the audience will feel like you are addressing them directly, and that kind
                of interpersonal communication makes sure that no one is going to lose interest
                on you, moreover they will start responding to you.</span></p>

                example, our stories should exclude any kind racism, sexism, biasness, and

                everyone, I am Samiul Islam. Today I am going to talk about asteroid, which is
                very much unknown to many of you, as it was unknown to me until now. Asteroid
                is a small rocky body orbiting the sun. Large numbers of these, ranging
                enormously in size, are found between the orbits of mars and Jupiter, though
                some have more eccentric orbits. I think I am little bit successful by
                introducing you to asteroid. Asteroids are very normal to fly by earth. They
                are not hazardous nor does it pose any threat to Earth. The asteroids are given
                names too, for instance the asteroid that will fly by on 29 of April is named
                as 1998 OR2. This rock has an estimated diameter of 1.1 to 2.5 miles. Its
                closest approach will be 3.9 million miles away from Earth which means it is 16
                times the average distance between Earth and the mood. Phew! We are saved. NASA
                has classified asteroid 1998 OR 2 as “potentially hazardous” not because it
                puts Earth in danger but it puts certain criteria in the agency’s
                classification scheme. According to NASA, asteroid 1998 OR2, which orbits the
                sun in between the orbits of Earth and Mars, will not fly by Earth again until
                May 18, 2031, only if we can defeat Corona Virus. Sorry, lame joke!&nbsp;</span></p>

                on to why I am humoring you about asteroid? Well after reading that post from
                social media, I kind of got scared as of the current situation everyone is
                panicking. Almost 80% news of social media is either a rumor or fake news. The
                rest 20% depends on your general knowledge or a relevant source. Like I have
                said before I panicked after reading the post, so I decided to do some research
                on this particular topic “Asteroid”. If you search it on Google you will get a
                lot of information about asteroid and like I have said before, maximum of the
                report will give you wrong information and you will panic more. So I visited
                the web page of NASA. Guess what i found? Asteroid is harmless. In simple word
                they are rocks with fire, which do keep going around the space. Even if they
                hit the Earth, before reaching our platen the fire will go away and a piece of
                rock will hit, which by the way never happened. Moreover NASA knows about this
                asteroid and its closure to Earth many years ago, and if any such hazard were
                to occur, they would have warned the people of Earth right when they knew the danger.
                That post was completely absurd but gave me knowledge. I just enlightened
                myself.&nbsp;</span></p>

                style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Now,
                you might ask, if so may asteroid pass by the Earth, how come we have never
                seen any? Well, first of all we do not always keep an eye on the sky, bad joke.
                Second we do see them but do not know that it is an asteroid. The reason is
                they are so far away that their blazing fire shines like a start. You will
                often mistake an asteroid with a shooting start. You will see a start moving
                and think, it is a shooting star and makes a wish but it can an asteroid and
                your wish will never come true. We go to university and learn only what our
                course requires, some even learn beyond that. There are thousands of things
                which we are unknown to. Asteroid is very common among the students who had
                studied science but very much new to the other people. The only reason to talk
                about the asteroid is it at first gives you a scary look but after studying it
                you will find it quite petty. This Saturday which is the 28 of March, 2 other
                asteroid can be seen in the sky. If you want you can have few cups of coffee
                that day, keep yourself up, stare at the sky and look for it. And, if you are
                successful seeing it, please let me know! Thank you everyone for your precious
                time and listen to my fruitful speech.</span></p>

                let’s start from the beginning, what is Corona Virus? According to World Health
                Organization, “Corona virus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused
                by a newly discovered corona virus.” The corona virus (Covid-19) has started in
                China and spreading rapidly around the world. A question might be raise in your
                mind that, “how dangerous is the corona virus?” well i don’t yet know how
                dangerous the new corona virus is, and i won’t know until more data comes in,
                but what i know now is, it can make some people a little sick with a slight
                runny nose. Other people get more sick and can have difficulty to breathing and
                develop pneumonia. Some people get very sick and need to be hospitalized. Among
                those, some of them unfortunately died. If we estimates the mortality rate by
                covid visualizer, in Chain there are 81,736 persons are contaminated and 3,291
                persons are dead, in Italy there are 74,386 persons are contaminated and 7,503
                persons are dead, in Spain 49,515 persons are contaminated 3,647 persons are
                dead and in Bangladesh 28 person are active corona patient and 5 person died.
                Though this number is lower than other countries we should take necessary steps
                before it’s too late.&nbsp; So how does it spread? The corona virus spreads
                mostly through person-to-person contact within about a 6 - feet radius. People
                with COVID-19, spread viral particles through coughing and sneezing. The
                particles can land in the mouths or noses of those nearby. It might also be
                possible to catch by touching a surface where the virus has recently landed and
                then touching one's mouth, nose or eyes. I have seen that many of the people
                are using face mask.&nbsp; Face masks are not effective protection for people
                who are well, but people who are already ill can wear them to reduce the
                likelihood that they'll cough or sneeze droplets on loved ones. The best
                practice is to maintain social distance. You might be thinking that what is
                social distance? Do we need to stay of our society? Well you don’t need to stay
                out of the society, the only thing you need to do is creating physical distance
                from other people, that’s why i ask you to sit at a distance of at least 6
                feet.&nbsp; At the community level, it means closing schools, restaurants,
                shops, movie theaters, and other places where people gather also not getting
                together in person with friends, not going to stores unless it is necessary if
                you can start working from home, not taking public transportation, including
                bus, Leguna, or rideshares. For those who use to live in hostel, try to
                avoiding physical contact with your roommates and always use hand sanitizer,
                mask and try to separate your own necessary things.&nbsp;</span></p>

                150%'><span lang=EN style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:150%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>And
                if anyone is affected by corona he/she must keep him/her self in self isolation
                so that he/she may not affects other people. So if you want to live a healthy
                life and keep your friends, family and beloved person safe please stay home and
                keep social distance.&nbsp; Otherwise we all need to suffer together. While

                is my childhood friend &amp; undoubtedly; we grew up together and spend a long
                time together. I always saw, he was full of life, dreamy, passionate about his
                dreams. He always wanted to make his dreams come true. When we were kids, we
                used to play different type of game, which was called &quot;Businessman's
                game&quot; and in which he always used to play the role of the Owner of the
                company and guess what? I was his business partner. Ever since his childhood he
                wanted to be a successful businessman, and which I always expected him to be
                one, and here he is, receiving awards for his hard works and talent. I always
                saw he was Creative, full of hopes &amp; dreams and saw with my own eyes how
                his failure turned into success. I'm very proud of him.</span></p>

                me talk about his organization which is known as “<b>Creative Home”. </b>Well
                creative home gives people chances to learn new &amp; different things, so that
                they can make their lives useful, meaningful and also being creative. This
                Creative Home isn’t his first business, before starting Creative Home he tried
                many businesses &amp; worked hard but failed, as we all know, &quot;Failures
                are the pillars of success&quot;, Samiul Islam is a perfect example for that
                proverb. I appreciate his hard work &amp; patience, &amp; obviously without his
                patience this wasn’t going to happen.</span></p>

                some people fail &amp; they loose their hope and stop working on their idea
                they started, I think this Creative home &amp; its owner both can motivate this

                should know about a lot of thing before starting a business, how to invest,

                if it's going to work or not, analyzing the return on investments and also it’s
                outside partners. Most of the people lose their hope at initial stages after
                their initial failure, but they shouldn’t. They must be patient to gain
                success, without working hard or being patient that's totally not going to
                happen. People minds constantly jump and work on new ideas and bring solutions
                to the problems. Problems should have new solutions with new ideas. The youth
                should think with their brains &amp; try to do something new &amp; creative.
                All the successful businessman always remained patient and also advised to be
                patient &amp; creative, it's a world full of creativity.&nbsp;</span></p>

                are thousands of motivational speeches about business, but firstly people

                Some people think that the people from Business Studies background knows a lot

                about business comes with experiences, failures &amp; achievements not with

                successful businessman for sure. Because there are a lot of things to know
                &amp; learn by experiencing things, by noticing, by implementing, by thinking
                and also by controlling. We can see real example in front of us, being an arts
                background student how he build up an organization. Besides being an excellent
                businessman Samiul Islam is also a great human with beautiful personality. You
                must know that; his company donates 15% of their profits to the poor people
                &amp; orphanage every year. They also built a school for the poor children
                &amp; they teach them for free. Proud to have a friend like him. I would like
                to appreciate Samiul &amp; his team for doing such amazing social work as
